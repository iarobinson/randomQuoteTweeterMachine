## Thoughts on Development Process

This is part of my Free Code Camp curriculum. I learned about the beauty of jQuery while working on this project. Derek Sivers convinced me to learn HTML5 and vanilla JavaScript (JS) in this blog:

https://sivers.org/prog

That was a good idea because It helped me learn the core of how JS interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM).

During this project I wrote it initially in vanilla JS, but because Bootstrap requires jQuery, there was some jQuery in my JS files. I wanted consistency across the project so I rewrote the vanilla JS into jQuery. While doing that something clicked for me.

I'm a big fan of jQuery now.

## Thank You

Boot strap, jQuery and HTML5 made this project a walk in the park. Thank you all.

### BIG THANK YOU to JORDAN WEST!

I swiped his quotes from News Feed Eradicator to make this quote machine. New feed eradicator has probably saved me hundreds of hours in avoiding the facebook attention machine. Now it saves me hours with it's selection of quotes easily organized into a JSON file I could swipe and use for my own purposes.
